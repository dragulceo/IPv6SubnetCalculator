IPv6 Subnet Calculator
======================

An application made some time ago for a friend. It duplicates his [c script](https://github.com/dragulceo/IPv6SubnetCalculator/blob/master/docs/main.c) and calculates the IP v6 address for a subnet with specified masks.

Built with: [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and
[jsbn](https://github.com/jasondavies/jsbn)
